Mackenzie N. Pitts is a PhD student at the University of Washington in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. She is interested in developing and implementing computational tools to support personalized clinical care. She earned her Bachelor's of Mechanical Engineering from Auburn University.

Mackenzie's doctoral research leverages data science and machine learning to understand patient-specific gait patterns for children with cerebral palsy. She is advised by [Dr. Kat Steele](https://steelelab.me.uw.edu/) and works closely with [Dr. Michael Schwartz](https://www.gillettechildrens.org/care-team/michael-schwartz-phd-clinical-scientist) and the gait analysis team at Gillette Children's in St. Paul, Minnesota. Mackenzie completed an internship at Gillette to gain exposure to patient care and understand the impacts of engineering in clinical settings. She also enjoys teaching and training for topics in dynamics, machine learning, and biomechanics.

When not tied to work, Mackenzie enjoys cooking, playing guitar, and trying new coding projects to hone her skills.
